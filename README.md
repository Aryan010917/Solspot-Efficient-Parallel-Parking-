# Solspot-Efficient-Parallel-Parking-
The project aims to make parking easier in crowded areas by allowing cars to move left, right, forward, backward, rotate 360\u00b0, and perform tank rotation using ESP32, L298N motor driver, UBEC, and solar panel. It uses Wi-Fi for remote control and solar charging, saving power and reducing costs while improving parking efficiency.
